# easter_egg

Hi, this little code wants to provide a MAX of 3 eggs to users requiring them for the Easter Hunt Event of the Youth Team.

**Commands avaible:**

1 .easteregg  : only command used by users. Notices the image of the egg.      

2 .giveegg    : only used by admins. Manually give an egg to an user, avoiding the counter.         


The only data stored will be the user's nicks.
